# CO3005 - Principles of Programming Languages - Assignments - HCMUT - HK232
- Description: ZCode is a programming language which is created to help students learn the principles of programming language and how to build a compiler for a programming language. In this assignment, I implemented Lexer and Parser Analysis, Abstract Syntax Tree Generation, Static Checker, and Code Generation for ZCode.
- Score: 
  + Lexer: 84/100
  + Parser: 97/100
  + AST Generation: 100/100
  + Static Checker: 38/100 ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
  + Code Generation: 24/100 ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
 
# Test code
